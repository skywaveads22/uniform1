        </ul>

        <h2>Labor Standards in Uniform Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
          Comprehensive ethical sourcing begins with ensuring appropriate labor conditions throughout the supply chain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fair Compensation Practices:</strong> Verification that all workers throughout the supply chain receive living wages appropriate to their local economies, with particular attention to subcontracted facilities where wage violations are 3-4 times more common.</li>
          <li><strong>Working Hours and Conditions:</strong> Monitoring systems to prevent excessive overtime, particularly during seasonal production peaks when school uniform manufacturing facilities commonly experience 40-60% production volume increases.</li>
