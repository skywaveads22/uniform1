              <h2>The Science of Fire Protection in Aviation Environments</h2>
              
              <h3>Understanding Fire Dynamics in Aircraft</h3>
              <p>
                Aviation fire incidents present unique challenges that distinguish them from terrestrial fire scenarios, requiring specialized protective materials and protocols:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Fire Spread:</strong> Aircraft cabin environments can experience flash fires that spread at rates exceeding 15 feet per second</li>
                <li><strong>Toxic Gas Generation:</strong> Burning aircraft materials produce lethal concentrations of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and other toxic gases</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Escape Routes:</strong> Confined aircraft spaces with restricted egress paths demand maximum protection time</li>
                <li><strong>High-Temperature Exposure:</strong> Aircraft fires can reach temperatures exceeding 1,000°C (1,832°F) within minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen-Rich Environment:</strong> Pressurized cabin environments can accelerate combustion rates significantly</li>
              </ul>
