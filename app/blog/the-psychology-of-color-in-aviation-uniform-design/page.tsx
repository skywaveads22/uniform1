              <ul>
                <li><strong>Neural vulnerability amplification:</strong> Elevated passenger stress hormones create heightened susceptibility to chromatic influence</li>
                <li><strong>Spectral isolation environment:</strong> Cabin lighting systems allow unprecedented control over color wavelength perception</li>
                <li><strong>Extended neural exposure window:</strong> Transcontinental flight durations permit sustained chromatic conditioning impossible in other sectors</li>
