              <p>
                PCMs represent one of the most significant advances in thermoregulating textiles, functioning as microscopic heat reservoirs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Microscopic capsules containing materials that change from solid to liquid at specific temperatures, absorbing excess heat during the phase transition</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Incorporated into fibers or applied as fabric treatments in medical scrubs and undershirts</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Provides active cooling when body temperature rises and releases stored heat when temperature drops</li>
                <li><strong>Saudi adaptation:</strong> PCMs calibrated for the 29-35°C transition range have proven most effective in Saudi healthcare settings</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Studies from King Fahad Medical City showed that PCM-enhanced undershirts reduced perceived heat stress by 27% compared to conventional cotton undershirts, with particularly strong results for staff working in emergency departments and mobile care units.
