              <h2>Leasing Benefits</h2>
              <p>
                Leasing uniforms offers several strategic advantages for healthcare facilities. This approach reduces upfront capital expenditure, provides flexibility in uniform management, and typically includes comprehensive maintenance services. Hospitals can benefit from regular updates to their uniform inventory without the burden of managing replacement cycles.

            <section>
              <h2>Buying Benefits</h2>
              <p>
                The purchase model presents distinct advantages for certain healthcare facilities. While requiring higher initial investment, buying uniforms can result in significant long-term cost savings and provides complete control over uniform quality and management. However, facilities must consider the responsibilities of maintenance, replacement scheduling, and inventory management.

              <h2>Considerations for Hospitals</h2>
              <p>
                The optimal choice between leasing and buying depends on various institutional factors. Key considerations include operational budget constraints, facility size, staff turnover rates, and specific uniform requirements. Healthcare facilities must evaluate these factors alongside their long-term strategic objectives to determine the most suitable uniform management approach.
