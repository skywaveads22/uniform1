                Ground staff uniforms at Saudi airports serve as critical safety equipment that ensures worker visibility, protection, and operational efficiency in one of the world's most demanding aviation environments. With Saudi Arabia's airports handling millions of passengers annually and supporting the Kingdom's Vision 2030 aviation expansion goals, proper ground staff uniforms are essential for maintaining the highest safety standards while supporting efficient airport operations.
              </p>

              <h2>The Critical Importance of Ground Staff Visibility</h2>
              <p>
                Airport ground operations present unique safety challenges where visibility can mean the difference between life and death. Ground staff work in close proximity to aircraft, ground support equipment, and vehicular traffic in environments where noise levels make verbal communication difficult. High-visibility uniforms serve as the primary safety barrier, ensuring that ground personnel are clearly visible to pilots, equipment operators, and other airport personnel at all times.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Saudi airports, including major hubs like King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, and King Fahd International Airport in Dammam, operate around the clock in varying lighting conditions. Ground staff uniforms must provide consistent visibility during daylight operations, dawn and dusk periods, and nighttime activities when artificial lighting creates challenging visual environments.
              </p>

              <h2>High-Visibility Standards and Regulations</h2>
              
              <h3>International Safety Standards</h3>
