                <p className="text-sm mb-0">
                  In its 2024 uniform refresh, Saudia implemented a sophisticated accessory architecture featuring a proprietary "Heritage Horizons" pattern system. The design employed traditional Saudi geometric patterns reimagined through a contemporary lens, creating a signature visual language across scarves, ties, and pocket squares.
              </p>
                <p className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0">
                  The pattern system utilized a mathematical approach to traditional Islamic geometry, with seven primary motifs representing different regions of the Kingdom. These elements were rendered in a precise color palette derived from Saudi landscapes, with specific hues assigned to different crew classifications. The system created 21 distinct accessory variations while maintaining consistent brand identity. Post-implementation research showed 87% improved brand recognition in passenger testing compared to the previous accessory system.
