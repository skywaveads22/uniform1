              <h2>Key Design Principles for Concierge Uniforms</h2>
              <p>
                Concierge uniforms must exude sophistication, authority, and approachability:
              </p>

              <h3>Impeccable Tailoring & Fit</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Bespoke or Semi-Bespoke Construction:</strong> Precision tailoring ensures a flawless fit, reflecting the hotel's attention to detail.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Silhouettes:</strong> Well-defined jackets and trousers project competence and professionalism.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Fabric Selection:</strong> High-thread-count wool blends, silk accents, and advanced technical fabrics for durability and comfort.</li>
                <li><strong>Harmonious Color Palettes:</strong> Colors aligned with hotel branding, often incorporating deep navies, charcoals, or rich earth tones with elegant accents.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Functional Elegance</h3>
              <ul>

              </ul>

              <h2>Optimizing Bell Staff Uniforms for Performance and Presentation</h2>
              <p>
                Bell staff uniforms require a balance of robust functionality and refined aesthetics:

                Uniforms must navigate the intersection of international luxury standards and Saudi cultural values:
