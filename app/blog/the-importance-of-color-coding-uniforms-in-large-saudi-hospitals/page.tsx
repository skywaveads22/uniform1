                  Saudi Arabia's healthcare sector has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, with the Kingdom investing heavily in state-of-the-art medical facilities. With this expansion comes increased complexity in managing larger healthcare teams across sprawling hospital campuses. The Ministry of Health (MoH) has recognized the value of standardized uniform policies that incorporate color-coding systems to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-6">
                  Traditional Saudi healthcare attire has evolved from simple white coats to sophisticated uniform systems that balance professionalism, cultural considerations, and practical functionality. Today's approach incorporates color as a key differentiator between departments, specialties, and staff roles.
                </p>

                <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-neutral-950">
                  Key Benefits of Color-Coded Hospital Uniforms
                </h2>
                
                <h3 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-950">
                  1. Immediate Staff Identification
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-6">
                  Perhaps the most significant advantage of color-coding is the ability for patients, visitors, and other staff to quickly identify healthcare workers by their role. In emergency situations, this immediate visual recognition can be crucial. For example, many Saudi hospitals now use:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-4 list-disc pl-8 text-neutral-700">
                  <li>Navy blue scrubs for physicians</li>
                  <li>Light blue or teal for nursing staff</li>

                <p className="mt-6">
                  For patients navigating large Saudi hospitals, color-coded uniforms reduce confusion and anxiety. Patients can more easily recognize who to approach for specific needs, building confidence in their care experience. This is particularly valuable in a cultural context where some patients may feel more comfortable approaching certain healthcare providers based on gender or specialty.
                </p>

                <h3 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-950">
